<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I am a Computer Science student at Aalto University with over five years of
  experience in the software development industry. I currently specialize in
  full-stack web development, but in the future, I want to develop other kinds
  of exciting software too. I have been programming in my spare time since
  junior high school, during which time I have gained a lot of experience in a
  wide variety of software projects.

<h3>Other achievements</h3>

  I have participated twice in the national TuKoKe science competition. In the
  spring of 2022, I and Justus Hansen programmed an agent-based simulation model
  that we used to study the sufficiency of electric car charging infrastructure.
  As a prize, we got to travel to Atlanta in the United States to participate in
  the annual ISEF science competition. Our study can be found&nbsp;<a
