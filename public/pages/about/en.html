<p>
  Hi, it's great that you've found your way here to my portfolio page! My name
  is <span>Joonatan</span> and I'm a fourth year computer science student at
  Aalto University. I'm a long time programmer and I have more than 5 years of
  experience in the <span>software development industry</span>. Currently I
  specialize in full-stack web development, but in the future I would like to
  develop other kinds of software as well. I have been programming in my spare
  time since junior high school, and during this time I have gained a lot of
  experience in different software projects.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time I like to go outdoors, play the piano and play badminton. I
  also participate in lot of guild activities, and this year I'm the
  <span>fuksi captain</span> of the computer science guild at Aalto! As the
  fuksi captain, my job is to introduce new students to the Finnish teekkari
  culture and student life at Aalto University. In the past I have also been the
  chair of the guild's digital services committee and been active in guild
  activities.

  I have participated twice in the national TuKoKe science competition. In the
  spring of 2022, I and Justus Hansen programmed an agent-based simulation model
  that we used to study the sufficiency of electric car charging infrastructure.
  As a prize, we got to travel to Atlanta in the United States to participate in
  the annual ISEF science competition. Our study can be found&nbsp;<a

  In the spring of 2021, I and Meeri Kuoppala made a study about the teaching of
  programming in Finnish high schools. Our study can be found&nbsp;<a
